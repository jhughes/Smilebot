Smilebot is a remote controlled 'roomba' robot with live video feed. The remote control is an android phone that receives video from an android phone mounted on the robot. This 'relay' phone takes commands from any controller phones, and passes those commands on to the robot. The robot executes these commmands as long as they are safe.
